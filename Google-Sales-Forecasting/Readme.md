# Google Sales Forecasting with Different Algorithms

This directory contains Python notebooks that implement various algorithms for time series forecasting on Google Stock Price data. Each notebook focuses on a different algorithm for predicting Google's stock price.

## Notebooks

1. **Google_Stock_Prediction_ARIMA.ipynb**
   - This notebook contains the implementation of AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) for forecasting Google's stock price.

2. **Google_Stock_Prediction_LSTM.ipynb**
   - In this notebook, we explore Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for time series forecasting of Google's stock price.

3. **Google_Stock_Prediction_Prophet.ipynb**
   - This notebook demonstrates the use of the Prophet forecasting model developed by Facebook for predicting Google's stock price.

4. **Google_Stock_Prediction_XGBoost.ipynb**
   - Here, we utilize the XGBoost algorithm to forecast Google's stock price based on historical data.

## Getting Started

To run and experiment with these notebooks, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook environment on your computer.

3. Navigate to the `Google-Sales-Forecasting` directory within the cloned repository.

4. Open one of the notebooks mentioned above using Jupyter Notebook.

5. Follow the instructions and code within the notebook to perform forecasting with the respective algorithm.

## Dataset

Ensure that you have the Google Stock Price dataset available in the same directory or specify the dataset's path according to the notebook's instructions. You may refer to the main README.md in the root directory for more information on dataset organization.

## Results

Each notebook includes detailed explanations, code, and the evaluation of the forecasting results. You will find performance metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to assess the accuracy of each algorithm's predictions.
