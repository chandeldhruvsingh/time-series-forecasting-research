# Data Analysis in the Cloud Research Repository

Welcome to the "Data Analysis in the Cloud" research repository. This repository contains the code and findings from our research project focused on time series forecasting using various algorithms on five different datasets. 

## Datasets

We have conducted time series forecasting on the following five datasets:

1. **Google Stock Price Data**
2. **Apple Stock Price Data**
3. **Rossman Sales Data**
4. **Walmart Sales Data**
5. **IoT Sensor Data**

Each dataset is located in its respective directory within this repository.

## Algorithms

We applied the following four algorithms to perform time series forecasting:

1. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**
2. **AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) / Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA)**
3. **Prophet**
4. **XGBoost**

The code for each algorithm's implementation can be found within the respective dataset directories.

## Performance Evaluation

We benchmarked the performance of each algorithm by evaluating the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values. You can find the results and RMSE values in the respective dataset directories as well.

## Directory Structure

The repository follows the following directory structure:

- `Apple-Sales-Forecasting`
- `Google-Sales-Forecasting`
- `IoT-Sensor-Data-Forecasting`
- `Rossman-Sales-Data`
- `Walmart-Sales-Data`

Feel free to explore each dataset folder to access the data, code, and evaluation results specific to that dataset.
