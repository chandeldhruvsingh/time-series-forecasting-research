Time Series Forecasting Models for Rossman Sales Data

Overview
This repository contains code for four different time series forecasting models applied to Rossman sales data. Each model utilizes different algorithms and libraries to predict future sales data. The primary objective is to compare and evaluate the performance of these models based on Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values.

Model 1 (SARIMA)
Overview
Objective: To predict sales within a specified date range.
Algorithm Used: Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA).
Language: Python.
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels.

Usage
Install the required libraries if not already installed: pip install pandas numpy matplotlib statsmodels
Modify the data source, preprocessing steps, and SARIMA model parameters in the Jupyter notebook as per your specific Rossman sales data.
Execute the Jupyter notebook: SARIMA_Model.ipynb.
